# meteorological-station
Repository containing the project for a meteorological station using ESP32.

The data collected can be visualized using the ThingSpeak website (where the database is stored)

We also uploaded an CSV file generated from the database which can be downloaded and uploaded in the following site, allowing the user to see graphically the data collected (in this case its limited by the authors
since we are limited by the ThingSpeak website to allow users to directly download the CSV file, so this works more as an example of the data collected in a period of time)
